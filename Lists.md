# Python Lists

### Declaration
- A list in Python is declared by placing elements inside square brackets `[]`.
- Elements are separated by commas.
- Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists.

- Lists can also be treated as strings.
- Means we can use slicing and spliting in lists.
- We can also use list methods like append, extend, insert, remove, pop, index,

### String comprehension in python

- You can give condition in the list it self and then run a loop accordingly
